# Serena's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository!

# About Me
My name is Serena Cao. I'm a [*senior*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/unc). Some hobbies of mine include cooking and restaurant-hopping! I am currently working on an extensive excel list that rates various restaurants nearby (it may never be completed I fear). 

I hope that I can produce a useful product via my project that people can use! 

Some fun facts about me:
1. I got knee surgery.
2. I do pottery.
3. I like to boulder.
