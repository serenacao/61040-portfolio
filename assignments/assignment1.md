# Assignment 1

## Domains
1. Mental health issues - for example, recognizing symptoms of decline and alerting before it becomes more serious 

My friends have expressed interest in building mental health related apps!

2. Saving money - I want to know if the purchase I'm making is valuable (maybe it is on sale) or if it is a fake sale. I want to know if there would be a cheaper place to buy the items that i want to buy

I was worrying the other day about where to buy my groceries and it took an hour to figure out where to go

3. What/where to eat - more of a "what" to eat, what am i craving, cannot pinpoint what I want to eat

My friends couldn't figure out where to eat and put all the pressure on me (I didn't know either)

4. Baking / cooking - substitutions, it is often difficult to find recipes that provide steps if you are missing a certain ingredient and also annoying to manually do the conversions of amount

I love baking and cooking! But I tend to want to make a recipe before checking if I have all the ingredients or not

5. Being consistent with habits - waking up, going to bed, working out

I want to be better at sleeping at more regular times, holding myself to promises I make to myself

6. Friendships, human connection - feeling lonely, wanting validation (how to resolve this feeling alone)

I think in this day and age people seek out validation to their own detriment and I would be interested to see if there could be something helpful

7. Efficient transportation, especially given a complicated itineary 

It took me 40 minutes (public transport) to get to somewhere 1.7 miles away. It would have taken 50 minutes to walk there. However, a bus runs there which makes it 20+ minutes, but it only runs at certain times.

8. Going outside, exploring - Going on walks and exploring, what to do on weekends

I really like going outside and exploring. I especially just like wandering new places and exploring shops. But sometimes I don't know what to do or where to go.

9. Coursework - ie What classes should i take to graduate (have filters like major, interests, max hours, credits)

 It takes me a long time to figure out what courses im taking and i have to switch across multiple tabs + click through multiple things, would be nicer if the process was more streamlined. 

10. Job applications - process is often repetitive since most applications ask the same thing but there are niche things like cover letters, other application questions that are company specific which slow down the process 

I apply to a lot of jobs unfortunately and the process is terrible

## Problems
### Domain 1: Job application
1. Making process faster - filling in for cover letters, custom questions
2. Multiple tabs, + especially annoying if it is via workday since you need to make an account for each company
3. Takes long time to look at requirements of job since it's usually at the bottom of the overview page
### Domain 2: Saving money
1. How to tell if something is on sale - I know that grocery stores like to have fake sales and I want to make a purchase that is wise
2. Planning what groceries to buy is difficult because I want to buy things that can actually be used to cook fulfilling meals while also not spending too much money
3. Knowing seasonal pricing
### Domain 3: Baking/Cooking
1. Conversion rate from one ingredient -> new ingredient is annoying, especially if you are making multiple substitutions
2. Leeway for how much you can be off for an ingredient (especially for baking) is not always clear, or how more of a certain ingredient can affect your product
3. What to substitute in a recipe if you are missing x ingredients?

## Selected problems 
1. Making process faster - filling in for cover letters, custom questions

I chose this because I think it would be really useful for people who apply to jobs, because there's already a really good app that fills in other details like resume + name + location, but is unable to fill in more specific questions (which makes sense)

2. How to know if something is on sale, and when to buy it cheaper

I often go to stores and see "50% off!!" but then turns out the store is just super marked up and 50% off is a reasonable price. I see this used a lot at restaurants + grocery stores where they have "good sales" but in reality it's been on sale ever since the store opened.

3. What to substitute in a recipe if you are missing x ingredients?

My brother has severe allergies and used to be allergic to eggs AND milk. Was very difficult trying to figure out recipes that heavily relied on egg and milk

## Unselected problems

1. Multiple tabs, + especially annoying if it is via workday since you need to make an account for each company

Making accounts would be nice but would only address a specific niche within job applications, companies generally have their own portals

2. Planning what groceries to buy is difficult because I want to buy things that can actually be used to cook fulfilling meals while also not spending too much money

Feels too ambitious + looks like it requires multiple apps

3. Knowing seasonal pricing

This seems like something already researched and not really necessary to have an app for

4. Conversion rate from one ingredient -> new ingredient is annoying, especially if you are making multiple substitutions

Didn't appeal to me as much, and it's also very difficult since it's recipe specific

5. Leeway for how much you can be off for an ingredient (especially for baking) is not always clear, or how more of a certain ingredient can affect your product

This is very difficult as well, and would more likely be something that requires training an AI model to guess (or just via experimentation)

6. Takes long time to look at requirements of job since it's usually at the bottom of the overview page

People apply without looking at requirements often + most are pretty generic



## Stakeholders
### Problem 1: Making process faster - filling in for cover letters, custom questions
1. Job applicants - directly affected because faster, higher-quality tools reduce stress and time spent on repetitive writing
2. Companies - more applicants may apply, and the applications they receive could be more polished
3. OpenAI - technology will shape employer-applicant relationships
### Problem 2: How to know if something is on sale, and when to buy it cheaper
1. Stores/Retailers - forced to increase transparency
2. Shoppers/Consumers - they often can’t tell if a “deal” is real and may overspend
3. Price Comparison Platforms - they can benefit from demand for better tools, but they may also face pressure from retailers who dislike being exposed
### Problem 3: What to substitute in a recipe if you are missing x ingredients?
1. People who eat the results - substitutions can affect taste, nutrition, and safety
2. Recipe creators - audience wants guidance on substitutions, and poor results lowers rating of recipe
3. Home cooks, bakers - directly affected when substitutions fail, leading to wasted time, money, or food

# Features 

### Problem 1: Making process faster - filling in for cover letters, custom questions
1. Smart Auto-Fill & Personalization – Pulls data from your resume/LinkedIn and tailors it to each company or role. Maybe in conjunction with an automatic AI checker afterwards. This would make it easier + potentially automated for applicants to complete job applications, though applicants should be encouraged to look it over. 
2. Template Library with Variations – Provides structured templates for different industries, tones, and question types. This makes it faster (but not automated) for applicants but might motivate companies to ask more niche questions as to avoid these situations.
3. Instant Feedback & Suggestions – Gives real-time guidance on tone, length, and how well the answer matches the job posting. This still requires writing up the entire paragraph on your own and isn't as fast as the first two options, but better aligns with recruiter intentions.

### Problem 2: How to know if something is on sale, and when to buy it cheaper
1. Price History Tracker – Shows historical trends for an item so you know if a “deal” is actually cheaper than usual. Will be helpful for customers to know if a price is truly cheaper, but less advantageous for businesses as it is harder to make fake "sales"
2. Best-Time-to-Buy Guide – seasonal patterns and past data (e.g. electronics cheaper in Nov, produce cheaper in summer) to recommend when to purchase. Will be helpful for customers to know if the product they are buying (if it is something like a new hair curling iron) might be cheaper if they buy it at a different and upcoming time. Not large impact on businesses, as while the product is cheaper, there is probably a higher volume of people who want the product. 
3. Comparison Engine – compares the same product across multiple retailers (online + local). Customers might appreciate this (mainly customers who might have good transportation options) but businesses (especially the ones who have the pricier option) might not appreciate it. 

### Problem 3: What to substitute in a recipe if you are missing x ingredients?
1. Role-Based Suggestions – explains why the ingredient is there (binder, leavener, sweetener, etc.) and gives targeted alternatives. Impact on bakers is that it allows more seamless (and last minute) substitutions as well as awareness on impact of substitution. 
2. Context Awareness – adjusts suggestions depending on dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, low-sodium) and what’s already in the recipe. This is catered mainly to people with allergens + allows for more widespread reach of recipe creators since they can cater to a broader audience.
3. Community-Verified Swaps – uses online user ratings/reviews for substitutions (reddit, food52). This builds collective knowledge for home cooks, and gives recipe posters feedback on common adjustments.
